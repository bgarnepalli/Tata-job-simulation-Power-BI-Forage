To prepare for your meeting, you need to draft questions that you think will be important and relevant to the CEO and CMO. This preparation will be your guide as you develop your presentation. For this task, you are only required to draft the questions. Make sure to think both quantitatively and qualitatively. You’ve been provided a dataset in the resources below to use as the basis for your exploration. Review this data, taking note of what information has been provided, what insights you can garner, and what is relevant to both the CEO and CMO respectively.

Questions to the CEO:

  Which country/Region is on top as Unit price and Sum of Quantity wise?
  Which Month has highest Sales or Revenue?
  Region wise decrease or increase in Sales/Revenue by year?
  Highest Revenue Generating Product?

Questions to the CMO:

  What's the retentions trend of Customers?
  What's the Customer Trend?
  What are the repeated Customer Info or Which Product?
  How long does it take for a repeated customer to order again?


And the visuals should follow below criteria:

Data cleanup:
 Before you can begin the analysis, make sure that the data is cleaned properly. You have noticed that the data contains some returns to the store which are provided in negative quantities and there are unit prices which were input in error. You will need to perform the following steps to clean this data.

  1. Create a check that the quantity should not be below 1 unit
  2. Create a check that the Unit price should not be below $0

  Question 1
    The CEO of the retail store is interested to view the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011 only. He would like to view granular data by looking into revenue for each month. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur. This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the next year.
  
  Question 2
    The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue. Additionally, the CMO is also interested in viewing the quantity sold along with the revenue generated. The CMO does not want to have the United Kingdom in this visual.
  
  Question 3
    The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. He is interested in a visual that shows the greatest revenue generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue generating customers. The CMO wants to target the higher revenue generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products.
  
  Question 4
    The CEO is looking to gain insights on the demand for their products. He wants to look at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products. Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions that have high demand, he will initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more business from these regions. He wants to view the entire data on a single view without the need to scroll or hover over the data points to identify the demand. There is no need to show data for the United Kingdom as the CEO is more interested in viewing the countries that have expansion opportunities.

Used Power BI to generate the visuals.
